# Covid-19 precise stats

This project is aiming to provide the most up-to-date statistics about the
pandemic by searching for information on countries' official websites.

WHO receives data only once a day, therefore they always fall behind the real
numbers.

## How do I contribute?
* Look up your country's Ministry of Health's website
* See whether it uses ArcGIS to store and retrieve data
* Add your country to the script (examples provided)

*Warning*: the structure of the program is subject to enhancement!
